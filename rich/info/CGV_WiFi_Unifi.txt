We need to use putty to SSH into the device. You can SSH into your device using PuTTY for Windows or Console on MAC OS X.

For Windows:
1) Download PuTTY (http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html, use it under your own risk!)
2) Enter Hostname IP address (by default is 192.168.1.20), leave port as default and make sure you've selected protocol SSH
3) Press "Enter" button
4) Accept the certificate, then enter your username and password (by default credentials are ubnt in both cases) and press Enter key
5) If it works properly you will see XM5.x and a $ symbol, there you can enter the commands you want to use.

For MAC OS:
1) Open Terminal (Console) under Program and Utilities
2) Enter command "ssh -l (USERNAME) (IP ADDRESS)", by default username is ubnt and IP address 192.168.1.20, so enter "ssh -l ubnt 192.168.1.20"
3) Type Yes to accept the certificate, and press Enter key.
4) Enter your device's password, by default it's "ubnt".

After that, please try setting the inform URL by following these steps:

- SSH into the device and issue ‘syswrapper.sh restore-default’ to get back to factory settings.
- SSH into the device and type: mca-cli
- Next type: set-inform http://ip-of-controller:8080/inform

Make sure to enter the set-inform command multiple times.
